## Guidelines

>[!WARNING]
>These guidelines are here to help keep this project well-organized and easy to manage for me.

1. Before submission, please execute `typstyle -l 180 -t 4 -i src` to get your code clean
2. One Pull Request means one feature/component
3. Communication is necessary, please give your Pull Request a short, descriptive title with a quick explanation of the feature you developed. PR names should start with `feat`, `feat(component)`, `docs`, `chore`, ... for example `feat: adding voltage decorations to components`
